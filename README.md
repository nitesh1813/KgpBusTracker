This is an android application specfic to IIT Kharagpur and it tracks the buses operational in the campus. It tells the estimated time of arrival, location of the buses and location of the various bus stops.

It makes use of the GPS in the bus driver's phone to track the buses. The app can be generalized to track people and groups as well by removing the bus stops and renaming the buses.

It makes use of firebase ( https://firebase.google.com/ ) as a databse.
